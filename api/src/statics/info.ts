## Why this exists?
Creating a Sketch Assistant, and defining the rules that you want in it requires knowledge of JavaScript and NPM.

This API eliminates the need to create assistant packages manually and exposes multiple configurable rules.

A front-end will be coming soon, as well as a larger selection of rules.

## Guide to this API:
1. See all rules available with a GET request.
2. Request your package using POST, receive an ID.
3. Use the ID as a param to a GET request and receive your download.
